## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- Poetry (package manager)
- Basic understanding of crypto trading concepts

## Getting Started

### 1. Installation

First, ensure you have all prerequisites installed:
- Python 3.11 or higher
- Poetry (package manager)
- Basic understanding of crypto trading concepts

Then follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/chain-ml/alphaswarm.git
cd alphaswarm
```

2. Install Poetry if you haven't already:
```bash
pipx install poetry
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
# For basic installation
poetry install

# For development (includes testing tools)
poetry install --with dev
```

Note: Poetry manages its own virtual environments, so a separate virtual environment should not be required. Refer to the [Poetry documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/managing-environments/) for more information.

### 2. API Keys Setup

Before running the framework, you'll need to obtain several API keys:

1. **LLM API Key**:
   - [Anthropic API Key](https://www.anthropic.com/)
   - OpenAI coming soon...

2. **Blockchain Access**:
   - [Alchemy API Key](https://www.alchemy.com/) (required for blockchain data)
   - RPC URLs from [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) or [Infura](https://www.infura.io/) or another RPC provider of choice

3. **Optional - Telegram Bot** (for notifications):
   - Create a bot through [BotFather](https://t.me/botfather)
   - Get your chat ID by messaging `/id` to your bot

### 3. Environment Configuration

1. Create your environment file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Configure the required variables in your `.env` file.

#### Required environment variables:

LLM Configuration (at least one required):
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: Your Anthropic API key for using Claude models

Blockchain Access:
- `ALCHEMY_API_KEY`: Your Alchemy API key for accessing blockchain data

Ethereum Configuration (only if using Ethereum):
- `ETH_RPC_URL`: RPC endpoint URL for connecting to Ethereum network
- `ETH_WALLET_ADDRESS`: Your Ethereum wallet address for trading
- `ETH_PRIVATE_KEY`: Private key for your Ethereum wallet

Base Configuration (only if using Base):
- `BASE_RPC_URL`: RPC endpoint URL for connecting to Base network  
- `BASE_WALLET_ADDRESS`: Your Base wallet address for trading
- `BASE_PRIVATE_KEY`: Private key for your Base wallet

#### Optional configurations:

Testing environment variables:
- `ETH_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL`: Your Sepolia testnet RPC endpoint URL
- `ETH_SEPOLIA_WALLET_ADDRESS`: Your Ethereum wallet address for Sepolia testnet
- `ETH_SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY`: Private key for your Sepolia testnet wallet

Notification settings:
- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`: Required for sending alerts via Telegram bot
- `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`: Required chat ID for receiving Telegram alerts
- `TELEGRAM_SERVER_IP`: IP address for Telegram server (defaults to 0.0.0.0)
- `TELEGRAM_SERVER_PORT`: Port for Telegram server (defaults to 8000)

Logging configuration:
- `LOG_LEVEL`: Sets logging verbosity level (defaults to INFO)
- `LOG_FORMAT`: Custom format for log messages (default: "%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s")

#### Security Notes

- Never commit your `.env` file to version control
- Keep private keys secure and start with testnets
- Use separate API keys for development and production
- Consider using key rotation for production deployments

### 4. Additional Configuration

The framework uses YAML configuration files to define trading venues, token pairs, and other application-specific and trading-related settings. The main configuration file is `config/default.yaml`.

Key configuration sections:
- **LLM Configuration**: Model settings, provider details, and parameters
- **Network Environments**: Production and test network configurations
- **Trading Venues**: Supported DEXs with their supported pairs and settings for each chain
- **Chain Configuration**: 
  - Chain-specific wallet and RPC settings
  - Token addresses and decimals
  - Gas settings and transaction parameters
- **Telegram**: Bot configuration for notifications

Note: Always verify contract addresses from official sources.

## Usage

### Quick Start

In all examples below, set your Anthropic API key in the `.env` file or change the model ID to an OpenAI model if using openAI.

#### Basic Example: Quote for a token pair

[Basic Example 01 - Quote](examples/basic_example_01_quote.py) is a first "hello world" example that:
- Initializes the Alphaswarm agent with a token price checking tool
- Uses Claude 3 Sonnet to process natural language queries
- Connects to Base network to fetch real-time token prices
- Demonstrates how to query token pair prices (AIXBT/USDC) using natural language

Run the example:
```bash
# Make sure you've configured your .env file first!
python examples/basic_example_01_quote.py
```

#### Basic Example: Execute a token swap

[Basic Example 02 - Swap](examples/basic_example_02_swap.py) is a follow up example that:
- Initializes the Alphaswarm agent with a token swap tool
- Uses Claude 3 Sonnet to process natural language queries
- Connects to Ethereum Sepolia network to execute a token swap
- Demonstrates how to initiate a token swap (3 USDC for WETH) using natural language

Run the example:
```bash
# Make sure you've configured your .env file first!
python examples/basic_example_02_swap.py
```

#### Strategy Example: Check trading strategy and optionally execute it

[Basic Example 03 - Strategy](examples/basic_example_03_strategy.py) dives into the optional execution of a trading strategy given input signals that:
- Initializes the Alphaswarm agent with both strategy analysis and token swap tools
- Uses Claude 3 Sonnet to process natural language queries
- Defines a simple trading strategy: Swap 3 USDC for WETH on Ethereum Sepolia when price below 10000 USDC per WETH
- Evaluates the trading strategy conditions using real-time market data when triggered
- Conditionally executes trades only when strategy conditions are met

Run the example:
```bash
# Make sure you've configured your .env file first!
python examples/basic_example_03_strategy.py
```
