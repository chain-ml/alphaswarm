# AlphaSwarm

AlphaSwarm is a developer framework for autonomous crypto trading agents that leverages LLM-powered AI agents to process market signals and execute trading strategies. It enables both automated trading alerts and autonomous trading by analyzing on-chain data, social metrics, and market conditions in real-time.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- Poetry (package manager)
- Basic understanding of crypto trading concepts

## Getting Started

### 1. Installation

First, ensure you have all prerequisites installed:
- Python 3.11 or higher
- Poetry (package manager)
- Basic understanding of crypto trading concepts

Then follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/chain-ml/alphaswarm.git
cd alphaswarm
```

2. Install Poetry if you haven't already:
```bash
pipx install poetry
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
# For basic installation
poetry install

# For development (includes testing tools)
poetry install --with dev
```

### 2. API Keys Setup

Before running the framework, you'll need to obtain several API keys:

1. **LLM API Key** (at least one required):
   - [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/) or
   - [Anthropic API Key](https://www.anthropic.com/)

2. **Blockchain Access**:
   - [Alchemy API Key](https://www.alchemy.com/) (required for blockchain data)
   - RPC URLs from [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) or [Infura](https://www.infura.io/) or another RPC provider of choice

3. **Optional - Telegram Bot** (for notifications):
   - Create a bot through [BotFather](https://t.me/botfather)
   - Get your chat ID by messaging `/id` to your bot

### 3. Environment Configuration

1. Create your environment file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Configure the required variables in your `.env` file:

```bash
# LLM Configuration (at least one required)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key      # Required for OpenAI models
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key # Required for Anthropic models

# Alchemy Configuration
ALCHEMY_API_KEY=your_alchemy_key    # Required for blockchain data access

# Chain Configuration
## Ethereum (only required if using Ethereum)
ETH_RPC_URL=your_ethereum_rpc       # Required for Ethereum trading
ETH_WALLET_ADDRESS=your_eth_address # Required for ETH trading
ETH_PRIVATE_KEY=your_eth_key       # Required for ETH trading

## Base (only required if using Base)
BASE_RPC_URL=your_base_rpc          # Required for Base trading
BASE_WALLET_ADDRESS=your_base_address # Required for Base trading
BASE_PRIVATE_KEY=your_base_key      # Required for Base trading      
```

3. Optional configurations:

```bash
# Testing
ETH_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=your_sepolia_rpc  # For Ethereum testnet

# Notifications
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token      # Required for alerts
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=your_chat_id          # Required for alerts
TELEGRAM_SERVER_IP=0.0.0.0             # Default: 0.0.0.0
TELEGRAM_SERVER_PORT=8000              # Default: 8000

# Logging
LOG_LEVEL=INFO                         # Default: INFO
LOG_FORMAT="%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s"
```

#### Security Notes

- Never commit your `.env` file to version control
- Keep private keys secure and start with testnets
- Use separate API keys for development and production
- Consider using key rotation for production deployments

### 4. Additional Configuration

The framework uses YAML configuration files to define trading venues, token pairs, and other application-specific and trading-related settings. The main configuration file is `config/default.yaml`.

Key configuration sections:
- **LLM Configuration**: Model settings, provider details, and parameters
- **Network Environments**: Production and test network configurations
- **Trading Venues**: Supported DEXs with their supported pairs and settings for each chain
- **Chain Configuration**: 
  - Chain-specific wallet and RPC settings
  - Token addresses and decimals
  - Gas settings and transaction parameters
- **Telegram**: Bot configuration for notifications

Note: Always verify contract addresses from official sources.

## Usage

### Quick Start

#### Basic Example

In a first "hello world" example we are going to get the price of a token pair from available DEXes on Base.
Set your Anthropic API key in the `.env` file or change the model ID to an OpenAI model if using openAI.

Create a new file or reference existing one `examples/basic_example_01_quote.py` in your project directory:

```python
import dotenv
from alphaswarm.agent.agent import AlphaSwarmAgent
from alphaswarm.config import Config
from alphaswarm.tools.exchanges.get_token_price_tool import GetTokenPriceTool

dotenv.load_dotenv()
config = Config()

# Initialize tools
tools = [
    GetTokenPriceTool(config),  # Get the price of a token pair from available DEXes
]

# Create the agent
agent = AlphaSwarmAgent(tools=tools, model_id="anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022")


# Interact with the agent
async def main():
    response = await agent.process_message("What's the current price of AIXBT in USDC on Base?")
    print(response)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    import asyncio

    asyncio.run(main())
```

Run the example:
```bash
# Make sure you've configured your .env file first!
python examples/basic_example_01_quote.py
```

#### Follow-up Example: Execute a token swap

In a follow-up example we are going to execute a token swap on a supported DEX on Ethereum Sepolia.
Set your Anthropic API key in the `.env` file or change the model ID to an OpenAI model if using openAI.

Create a new file or reference existing one `examples/basic_example_02_swap.py`:

```python
import dotenv
from alphaswarm.agent.agent import AlphaSwarmAgent
from alphaswarm.config import Config
from alphaswarm.tools.exchanges.execute_token_swap_tool import ExecuteTokenSwapTool

dotenv.load_dotenv()
config = Config(network_env="test")  # Use a testnet environment (as defined in config/default.yaml)

# Initialize tools
tools = [
    ExecuteTokenSwapTool(config),  # Execute a token swap on a supported DEX (Uniswap V2/V3 on Ethereum and Base chains)
]

# Create the agent
agent = AlphaSwarmAgent(tools=tools, model_id="anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022")


# Interact with the agent
async def main():
    response = await agent.process_message("Swap 3 USDC for WETH on Ethereum Sepolia")
    print(response)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    import asyncio

    asyncio.run(main())
```

Execute the token swap:
```bash
# Make sure you've configured your .env file first!
python examples/basic_example_02_swap.py
```

### Strategy Example: Check a trading strategy and optionally execute it

In a follow-up example we are going to check a trading strategy and optionally execute it.
Set your Anthropic API key in the `.env` file or change the model ID to an OpenAI model if using openAI.

Create a new file or reference existing one `examples/basic_example_03_strategy.py`:

```python
import dotenv
from alphaswarm.agent.agent import AlphaSwarmAgent
from alphaswarm.config import Config
from alphaswarm.tools.exchanges.execute_token_swap_tool import ExecuteTokenSwapTool
from alphaswarm.tools.strategy_analysis.generic.generic_analysis import GenericStrategyAnalysisTool
from alphaswarm.tools.strategy_analysis.strategy import Strategy

dotenv.load_dotenv()
config = Config(network_env="test")  # Use a testnet environment (as defined in config/default.yaml)

# Initialize tools
strategy = Strategy(rules="Swap 3 USDC for WETH on Ethereum Sepolia when price below 10000 USDC per WETH", model_id="anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022")

tools = [
    GenericStrategyAnalysisTool(strategy), # Check a trading strategy
    ExecuteTokenSwapTool(config),  # Execute a token swap on a supported DEX (Uniswap V2/V3 on Ethereum and Base chains)
]

# Create the agent
agent = AlphaSwarmAgent(tools=tools, model_id="anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022")


# Interact with the agent
async def main():
    response = await agent.process_message("Check strategy and initiate a trade if applicable")
    print(response)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    import asyncio

    asyncio.run(main())

```

Execute the token swap conditionally based on whether the strategy is applicable:
```bash
# Make sure you've configured your .env file first!
python examples/basic_example_03_strategy.py
```
